# Calorimetry Lab - Example

This example demonstrates how the calorimetry calculations are performed using the provided experimental data and Python notebook.

## Code Example

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd


# Load the Excel data into a DataFrame
data = pd.read_excel("Calorimetry lab values.xlsx")

# Display the first few rows of the data
data.head()


# Calculate the heat (Q) using the formula Q = m * c * ΔT
data['Heat (J)'] = data['Mass of Water (g)'] * data['Heat Capacity of Water (J/g°C)'] * (data['Final Temp (°C)'] - data['Initial Temp (°C)'])

# Show the results
data[['Experiment No.', 'Heat (J)']]
