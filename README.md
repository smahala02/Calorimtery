# Calorimetry Lab Analysis

This repository contains the analysis and calculations for a calorimetry lab experiment. The main components are:

1. **Calorimetry Lab.ipynb**: A Jupyter notebook containing the detailed analysis, calculations, and explanations for various calorimetry experiments, including:
   - Specific heat capacity determination
   - Heat of solution determination
   - Latent heat capacity determination

2. **Calorimetry lab values.xlsx**: An Excel file containing the raw data and measurements from the lab experiments.

## Overview

The Jupyter notebook covers several key aspects of calorimetry:

- General understanding and unit conversions
- Coffee cup calorimetry experiments
- Calculations of heat capacities, heats of solution, and latent heat of fusion
- Error analysis and uncertainty calculations
- Comparisons with standard values and discussions on potential sources of error

## Usage

To view and run the analysis:

1. Open the `Calorimetry Lab.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
2. Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed (numpy is used in the notebook).
3. Run the cells to see the calculations and results.

## Data

The `Calorimetry lab values.xlsx` file contains the raw experimental data used in the analysis. This data is referenced and used throughout the Jupyter notebook.
