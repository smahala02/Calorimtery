# Calorimetry Lab
This project demonstrates a lab experiment related to **Calorimetry**, a method used to measure the amount of heat released or absorbed during chemical reactions or physical changes. It consists of a Python notebook (`Calorimetry Lab.ipynb`) and an Excel file (`Calorimetry lab values.xlsx`) that provides real experimental values for calorimetric calculations.

## Introduction
Calorimetry is an important technique in thermodynamics and physical chemistry. This repository contains tools and data for performing basic calorimetry experiments and calculations. The Python notebook automates the calculation of heat transfer, while the Excel sheet provides sample experimental data.

The Jupyter notebook covers several key aspects of calorimetry:

- General understanding and unit conversions
- Coffee cup calorimetry experiments
- Calculations of heat capacities, heats of solution, and latent heat of fusion
- Error analysis and uncertainty calculations
- Comparisons with standard values and discussions on potential sources of error

## Files in Repository
- **Calorimetry Lab.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook containing Python code to calculate calorimetry data from experimental values.
- **Calorimetry lab values.xlsx**: Excel sheet with data from calorimetry experiments for use in the Python notebook.
- **.gitignore**: Ignores temporary and unnecessary files in the project.
- **README.md**: The file you are currently reading, which explains the repository contents.

## Installation
To run the notebook on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
https://github.com/smahala02/Calorimetry.git

2. Install dependencies:
Ensure you have Python installed. You can create a virtual environment and install necessary libraries such as `pandas` and `numpy`.

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter notebook (`Calorimetry Lab.ipynb`) using JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook.
2. Load the `Calorimetry lab values.xlsx` file into the notebook as instructed to perform calculations.
3. Run the cells to compute the heat transfer and other relevant calorimetric data.
